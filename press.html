Collaborations, when they work, are a beautiful thing and quite a few of these sublime coming-togethers were part of this year’s National Arts Festival. One of the best, Antjie in Berlin, is a collaboration between artists from different genres who, with a stunning concept, created one of the most blissful and quite unusual moments at the festival.... Richards, who recently collaborated on one of William Kentridge’s huge stage shows, is perfect in her role as she allows the music to guide her performance. - <b>The Star</b></p>

                <hr/>
<p>South Africa’s only experimental concert piano diva Jill Richards sat down at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown last night and coaxed from her Steinway concert grand a meditation on South Africa as seen from abroad through the eyes of poet and author Antjie Krog. Antjie in Berlin is so delicate and so fierce that all you can really do is remove your glasses, close your eyes, cock your head and open your ears. </p><p>
Composed by South African-born, Denmark-based Rudiger Meyer, Antjie in Berlin brings to life letters from Germany as read by Krog and written to her mother, extracted from her book Begging to be Black. What Meyer and Richards do is ooze music into the spaces between the words. Their accomplice is sound designer Shaughn Macrae, who bleeds tech and echo into the room. The result is a kind of poetry that we’ve never heard before – with an anarchistic twist of contemporary South African issues. - <b>City Press</b></p>
<hr/>
<p>Dimitri Vassilakis [of the Ensemble Contemporain]  ... shared the score with South African Jill Richards, playing the chosen pages for the first time.

                        <p>Richards and Coetzee’s interpretation of [Beethoven’s] Sonata for piano and cello in D major op.102 was an unforgettable experience.

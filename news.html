                        <p class="bold">2017</p>
                       <p>I've worked with some wonderful musicians and other artists this year. April included an improvisational concert as part of the <a href="http://betwixtmusic.co.za/">Betwixt</a> experimental music series in Cape Town. This was a collaboration with Swiss artist Luca Forcucci (who works with electronics and field recordings) and Cara Stacey (a South African performer and ethnomusicologist who specialises in indigenous southern African instruments). The setting was a piano workshop - dirty, functional and a wonderful place to play. </p>
                       <p>I also performed at the <a href="http://www.edgeofwrong.com/sa/">Edge of Wrong</a> festival, an annual festival (also in Cape Town) curated by Morten Kristiansen which is literally...at the edge of wrong. </p>
<p>Away from the stage, I've been working with film maker Jurgen Meekel on a fascinating project involving glow-in-the-dark paint and lasers. Much to think about in terms of the different worlds of light and sound waves! This will see the light of day in February 2018. I have also been working on the sound design for an educational VR app, made for the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/origins/">Origins Centre</a> at Wits University, Johannesburg. </p>

<p>In September and October I will be in Europe, performing at the <a href="http://www.limmitationes.com/">Limmitationes</a> festival in Austria and at Das Institut in Zürich, where I will also be recording with Jeroen Visser and Beat Keller. I will be playing in Munich, as part of the Echtzeit series and at the Max-Planck institute for Biochemistry, where I will play molecular music by Jörg Schaffer. I will then perform works by Charlotte Seither and Andile Khumalo in Berlin. </p>
<p>I am also in the planning stages of an interdisciplinary project which will happen at William Kentridge's <a href="https://lessgoodidea.com/">Centre for the Less Good Idea</a> in Johannesburg. I look forward to collaborating with actors and visual artists for this project. </p>
